# PII Management Tool

## Overview

The **PII Management Tool** is a Python-based command-line application designed to help users manage Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in files and directories. The tool identifies, anonymizes, or replaces PII such as email addresses, IP addresses, AWS account numbers, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and more. It can process text files, JSON, and YAML files, and supports generating reports for identified PII.

## Features

- **PII Detection**: Identifies common forms of PII using regex patterns, including:
  - Email addresses
  - IP addresses
  - AWS account numbers and ARNs
  - GitHub/GitLab tokens
  - Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
  - Phone numbers
  - Credit card numbers
  - URLs
- **Anonymization**: Replaces detected PII with anonymized placeholders.
- **Replacement**: Substitutes detected PII with randomly generated dummy data.
- **File and Directory Scanning**: Processes individual files or entire directories.
- **Report Generation**: Generates a report file listing detected PII for auditing purposes.
